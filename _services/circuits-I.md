summary: In the electrical industry with its complex machines and instruments, it is easy to be overwhelmed by electrical engineering field and think that everything is complicated and difficult. However, with a strong knowledge of the basic concepts of electricity, it is possible to breakdown complicated systems to a simple, manageable circuit. Thus, in this chapter we will investigate the fundamental concepts, principles, and terminologies involved in electrical circuits.
