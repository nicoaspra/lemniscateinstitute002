summary: Have you ever considered how electricity affects almost every aspect of our lives? From the basic mechanisms of our bodies to the power it provides the materials and equipment around us - electricity is in and all around us, providing us with convenience, health, and abundance. Electricity is utilized by the cells of our body, enabling neurons to rapidly fire, our hearts to beat, and our muscles to contract. Likewise, in this modern era, almost all our basic needs are either made or sustained by electricity-powered machines. Hence, without electricity, our lives would be radically different and a whole lot harder. And as we acknowledge the big difference electricity makes, it is also important that we understand electricity through its history and how it was discovered.
