<p>In evaluating limits, we should always try to substitute the value for the function first before considering alternative solutions. Thus, in this case, substitute $x$ with 1,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	\lim_{x\to 1} |x+5| &amp;= |1+5| \\
	&amp;= |6| \\
	&amp;= 6		\tagans
\end{align*}\]

<p>Since we have arrived at a value, there is no reason for us to pursue alternative solutions. Hence, the limit of the function is 6.Â </p>
