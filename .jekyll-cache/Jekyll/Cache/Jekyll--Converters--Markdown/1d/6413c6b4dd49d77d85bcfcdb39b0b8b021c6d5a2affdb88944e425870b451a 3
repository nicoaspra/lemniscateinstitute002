<p><strong>Resistance</strong> is defined as the measure of the <strong>opposition to current flow</strong> in an electrical circuit.</p>

<p>It is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega $(\ohm)$.
All materials resist current flow to some degree. They fall into one of two broad categories: conductors and insulators.</p>

<p><strong>Conductors</strong> are materials that offer very <em>little resistance</em> where electrons can move quickly. Examples of conductors are silver, copper, gold, and aluminum. Electrical wires contain conductors, which are primarily used to transport electricity from one point to another.</p>

<p><strong>Insulators</strong> are materials that present <em>high resistance and restrict the flow of electrons</em>. Examples would include rubber, paper, glass, wood, and plastic. The common application of insulators is to provide outer covering to conductors in a wire.</p>

<h2 id="relationship-of-resistance-length-and-area">Relationship of Resistance, Length and Area</h2>

<p>To understand how we can solve the resistance of a given material through its physical properties, imagine water flowing through a tube; the wider the tubeâ€™s cross-sectional area, the more freely the water can flow. Additionally, the longer the tube is, the longer the time required for the water to pass through it.</p>

<p>Similarly, with a wire, its resistance can be determined as a function of its length and area. The <strong>resistance</strong> varies proportionally with its <strong>length</strong> and inversely with its <strong>area</strong>. Consequently, the longer the wire, the higher the resistance. On the other hand, the larger the area of the material, the lesser its resistance.</p>

<p>Mathematically, we can express it as:</p>

\[R \propto \frac{L}{A}\]

<p>Hence, by multiplying a proportianality constant â€œ$\rho$â€™â€™ we will get,</p>

	\text{Where:}\quad R &amp;= \text{resistance},\, [\mathrm{\ohm}] &amp; \\

<!-- The equation above can also be expressed in terms of the volume. Since the volume of a wire is defined as $V = AL$, then, 

$$
\begin{align}
    R = \rho\,\frac{L}{A} 
      = \rho\,\frac{L^2}{V} 
      = \rho\,\frac{V}{A^2}
\end{align}
