I"–<p>From the previous section, we already discussed the main difference between a scalar and a vector quantity and had some examples regarding this particular topic. To recall, distance is a scalar quantity, and displacement is a vector. Distance refers to ‚Äúhow much ground an object has covered.‚Äù While displacement refers to ‚Äúhow far the object is from its starting position,‚Äù we could also interpret this as a ‚Äúchange in its position.‚Äù</p>

<p>Distance is usually represented by the symbol $s$, and the displacement by the symbol $\vv{s}$. And since the displacement measures the change in position, if $s_i$ is the object‚Äôs initial position and $s_f$ is the final position, we can denote the displacement as,</p>
