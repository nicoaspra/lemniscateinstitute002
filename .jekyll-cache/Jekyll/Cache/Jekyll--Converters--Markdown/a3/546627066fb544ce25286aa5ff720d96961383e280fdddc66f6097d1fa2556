<p>From the past lessons, we have already established a clear understanding of what a function is. But aside from equations and tables, functions can also be represented in the form of graphs. For example, a function of $f(x)=x^2$, can be tabulated by assigning values to $x$.</p>

\[\begin{array}{c|rrrrrrr}
	x &amp; -3 &amp; -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;2 &amp;3 \\
	\hline
	f(x) &amp; 9 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 9 
\end{array}\]

<p>Moreover, this can be plotted on a cartesian plane, with your input (independent variable) lying on the horizontal axis and the output (dependent variable) on the vertical axis.</p>

<p>This topic may have been covered in previous prerequisite courses. However, to refresh your memory, consider the following examples.</p>

<p>$\example{1}$
Graph the equation of the line $y=-x+3$</p>

<p>$\solution$ <br />
There are a lot of ways of plotting a graph in a cartesian plane, but one of the simplest method is by assigning values to the independent variable, which in this case is $x$,</p>

<p>\(\begin{array}{c|cccc}
	x    &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
	\hline
	y &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\)
Trace the points on the cartesian plane after plotting them.</p>
