I"Ü<p>Let us begin our lesson with reviewing the concept of absolute value. <strong>Absolute value</strong> or sometimes called the <strong>modulus</strong> is the distance from zero in the number line. 
Since it only measures the <strong>distance</strong>, the resulting value will always be non-negative.</p>

<p>Simply put, the absolute value removes the negative sign of a number. So, for instance, the absolute value of $-5$ is 5, and the absolute value of 5 is also 5.</p>
