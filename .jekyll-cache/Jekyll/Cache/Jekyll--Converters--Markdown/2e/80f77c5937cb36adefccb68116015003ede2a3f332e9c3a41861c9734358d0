I"î<p>Integral Calculus has a lot of applications, but having no prior knowledge of what it really is, grasping its concepts can be a little overwhelming.
To start, let us first understand where the equation for the area of a circle comes from. 
$A = \pi r^2$, what really is $\pi$? and why $r^2$? If you come to think of it, $r^2$ is an area of a square with a side that has a length of $r$. And pi is simply the ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter $\pi = \frac{C}{d}$ (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>Areas of simple figures such as a square, a rectangle, or a triangle can be easily verified by simple logic.
Take the area of a square or a rectangle, for instance; if you are in a classroom and the chairs are perfectly arranged in a grid-like structure, we can easily figure out the number of chairs by multiplying the number of rows and columns.
With this in mind, the area can be represented by the total number of chairs in the room; it is simply length times width ($A=lw$).</p>

<p>Moreover, triangles are just rectangles split in half. So, figuring out the equation of the area of a triangle is not surprising; all you need to do is divide the area of the rectangle in half.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
    A_\text{tri} &amp;= \frac{A_\text{rec}}{2} \\
    A_\text{tri} &amp;= \frac12 bh
\end{align*}\]

<p>The area of the circle, on the other hand, is not that straightforward to figure out. To understand, let us start with a circle and cut it into concentric rings. Imagine that the circle, or the rings in particular, are made of a material that can be bent. If we cut from the center of the circle to the outermost ring, we can unroll the rings into strips of rectangles.</p>

        \filldraw[colorA!10] (0,0) circle (6);
        \filldraw[colorA!20] (0,0) circle (5);
        \filldraw[colorA!30] (0,0) circle (4);
        \filldraw[colorA!40] (0,0) circle (3);
        \filldraw[colorA!50] (0,0) circle (2);
        \filldraw[colorA!60] (0,0) circle (1);</p>

        \filldraw[colorA!20] (0,1) rectangle (5*2*pi, 2);
        \filldraw[colorA!30] (0,2) rectangle (4*2*pi, 3);

<p>Placing the strips side by side in an ascending order reveals a different shape: a shape that we already know how to solve, a simple right triangle.
Furthermore, we can make the thickness of the rings thinner to refine the shape further.
You might have already figured it out, the height of the triangle resembles the circleâ€™s radius and the base as the circumference.</p>

        \fill[shading = axis,rectangle, top color=colorA!60, bottom color=colorA!10] (0,0) â€“ (-6<em>2</em>pi, 0) â€“ (-6<em>2</em>pi, 6) â€“ cycle;</p>

    \draw [decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=4pt,raise=3pt}]
		(0,0-0.2) -- (-6*2*pi,0-0.2) node[midway,yshift=-15pt]{$C$};
\end{tikzpicture} \end{figure}

<p>Applying the equation of the triangle gives us,
\begin{align<em>}
    A &amp;= \frac12 Cr
\intertext{But $C=\pi d$,}
    &amp;= \frac12 (\pi d)r
\intertext{And we can also represent the diameter $d$ in terms of the circleâ€™s radius, $d=2r$}
    &amp;= \frac12 (2\pi r)r <br />
    &amp;= \frac{1}{\cancel{2}} (\cancel{2}\pi r^2) <br />
    A &amp;= \pi r^2
\end{align</em>}</p>

<p>Understanding the underlying concept of how formulas have been derived gives us a better understanding and appreciation of this kind of topic.</p>

<p>The core concept of integral calculus is taking the sum of infinitely small quantities to be represented as a whole. Its primary goal is simple and is equipped with some essential mathematical tools. As a result, problems that were once %unfathomably 
impossible to solve can now be easily manipulated using calculus.</p>
