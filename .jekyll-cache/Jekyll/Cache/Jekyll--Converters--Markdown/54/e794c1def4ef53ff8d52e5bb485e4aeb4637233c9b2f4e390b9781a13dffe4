I"3<p>From the previous lesson, we have already introduced motions with quantifiable velocities, such as constant velocities and average velocities. Moving on, this section will introduce varying velocities as a result of acceleration. 
But before we begin, let us define acceleration.</p>

<p>If you are travelling at a rate of 50 m/s, then after a second your rate increases to 60 m/s, and 70 m/s after the next second  (Figure 1). This indicates that you are increasing your pace as time passes or that you are ``accelerating.’’ According to our example, you are accelerating at a rate of 10 m/s per second, which is expressed as 10 m/s/s or 10 $\mathrm{m/s^2}$. With this, we can now define acceleration mathematically. It is the change in velocity with respect to time. Thus, acceleration can be denoted as,</p>
