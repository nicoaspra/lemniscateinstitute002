<p>The concept of limits may be new to you, but this is one of the basic foundations of calculus, distinguishing it from all the prerequisite mathematics you might have already undergone. Thus, in order to fully grasp the notions that we will soon encounter, we must first fully understand this topic.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a visual representation of what a limit is. Imagine you’re crossing a bridge $AB$ (see \fref{fig:intro to limits 1}), and you’re only allowed to move half of your current location starting at point $A$. With this, no matter how hard you strive to get to point $B$, you will never be at the exact point. But, yes, you’ll be able to get close enough to appear as if you’re stepping at point $B$. With this in mind, you’re approaching relatively close to point $B$ without actually getting there. Therefore, we can say that your limit is at point $B$.</p>

<h2 id="notation-of-limits">Notation of Limits</h2>
<p>Before attempting to answer problems in Limits, it is necessary to familiarize ourselves with its notation. Consider $f(x)$ as a function of $x$ and $a$ as a constant. In order for the function $f(x)$ to get relatively close to the Limit $L$, $x$ must be sufficiently close to $a$. This is denoted as,</p>

<p align="center" style="background-color:rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.07);
border: 3px solid rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.9);
border-radius:7px;
padding:10px;
margin:5px;">
    $$\begin{align}
        \lim_{x \to a}{f(x)}  = L
    \end{align}$$
</p>

<p>which is read ``the limit of the function of $x$, as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$’’. This can also be presented as,</p>

<p align="center" style="background-color:rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.07);
border: 3px solid rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.9);
border-radius:7px;
padding:10px;
margin:5px;">
    $$\begin{align}
	    f(x) \to L , \, \text{as} \, x \to a  
    \end{align}$$
</p>

<p>which is read “$f(x)$ approaches $L$, as $x$ approaches $a$”</p>

<p>To illustrate this, let us attempt to solve a few problems.</p>

<hr />
<p>$\example{1}$
Evaluate, $\lim\limits_{x \to 3}{(x-1)} $</p>

<p>$\solution$ <br />
In evaluating limits, it is best first to try to substitute the value of $a$ to the function. In this case, if we replace $x$ with 3, we end up with a value.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	\lim_{x \to 3}{(x-1)} &amp;= 3-1\\
	&amp;= 2		\tagans
\end{align*}\]

<p>But let’s try to solve this using the definition of what a limit is by
assigning values to $x$ that approaches $3$ from either sides:</p>
