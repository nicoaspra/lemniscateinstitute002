I"'<p>Just as distance and displacement have different definitions despite their similarities, so do speed and velocity. <strong>Speed</strong> is a <em>scalar quantity</em> that indicates “how fast an object moves,” while <strong>velocity</strong> is a <em>vector quantity</em> that refers to “the rate at which an object changes its position.” This notion may seem perplexing, but remember that vectors are always related to their orientation. Furthermore, in Physics, we are more concerned with velocity rather than speed since we also want to quantify the direction. However, before we can master this concept, we must first learn how to solve some problems without worrying its direction.</p>

<p>Velocity is usually represented by the symbol $\vv{v}$. Velocity, especially in real-world applications, may be more challenging to quantify than it seems, especially when referring to the instantaneous velocity. Let us have a simple example to illustrate this notion. For instance, a man traveled between cities. His velocity would undoubtedly vary due to traffic, curves, and other unanticipated situations. Yes, the man would be able to see his instantaneous velocity on his odometer, but calculating it would be daunting since it will require some calculus. Even so, not all parameters can be accounted for.</p>

<p>However, in this lesson, we are more concerned with what we call the average velocity. To determine the average velocity between two points, we can divide the total displacement by its time to finish the course. Average velocity is denoted as,</p>
