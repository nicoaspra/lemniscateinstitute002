I"S<p>Before attempting to answer problems in Limits, it is necessary to familiarize ourselves with its notation. Consider $f(x)$ as a function of $x$ and $a$ as a constant. In order for the function $f(x)$ to get relatively close to the Limit $L$, $x$ must be sufficiently close to $a$. This is denoted as,</p>

<p align="center" style="background-color:rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.07);
border: 3px solid rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.9);
border-radius:7px;
padding:10px;
margin:5px;">
    $$\begin{align}
        \lim_{x \to a}{f(x)}  = L
    \end{align}$$
</p>

<p>which is read ``the limit of the function of $x$, as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$’’. This can also be presented as,</p>

<p align="center" style="background-color:rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.07);
border: 3px solid rgba(64, 130, 110, 0.9);
border-radius:7px;
padding:10px;
margin:5px;">
    $$\begin{align}
	    f(x) \to L , \, \text{as} \, x \to a  
    \end{align}$$
</p>

<p>which is read “$f(x)$ approaches $L$, as $x$ approaches $a$”</p>

<p>To illustrate this, let us attempt to solve a few problems.</p>

<hr />
<p>$\example{1}$
Evaluate, $\lim\limits_{x \to 3}{(x-1)} $</p>

<p>$\solution$ <br />
In evaluating limits, it is best first to try to substitute the value of $a$ to the function. In this case, if we replace $x$ with 3, we end up with a value.
% We can easily evaluate limits like this by substituting 3 to $x$,
\begin{align<em>}
	\lim_{x \to 3}{(x-1)} &amp;= 3-1<br />
	&amp;= 2		\tagans
\end{align</em>}</p>

<p>But let’s try to solve this using the definition of what a limit is by
assigning values to $x$ that approaches $3$ from either sides:</p>
