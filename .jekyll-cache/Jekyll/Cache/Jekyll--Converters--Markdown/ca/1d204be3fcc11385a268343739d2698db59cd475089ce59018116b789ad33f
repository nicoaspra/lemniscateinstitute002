I"£<p>Angle measures the amount of turn between two lines that have a common point, which is called the vertex.</p>

<p>Various symbols can denote Angles, but Greek symbols most frequently represent them. And the most commonly used symbol for an angle is theta, $\theta$.</p>

<p>There are many units that can be used to describe an angle such as degrees, radians, gradians, and mils.</p>

<p>But in calculus, it is more practical to use radians to simplify the calculations, in later chapters we will understand why radians is more desirable to use than other units.</p>

<h2 id="radian">Radian</h2>
<p>Radian is a unit of angle that uses the radius of the circle to describe the angle. To elaborate this, consider $\fref{2}$, if the radius of a circle is laid along its circumference, the angle formed $\theta$ measures to 1 radian.</p>

<p>We can also figure out the relationship of radians to other units of angle by fully wraping the circumference of the circle using the length of the radius (\fref{fig:trigonometric function radian to 1 revolution}). Since the circumference of a circle is $C=2\pi r$, then the number of times the radius will be laid to fully wrap the circumference is $2\pi$ times or approximately 6.28 times.</p>

<p>Hence, one revolution in terms of radian is $2\pi$ rad.
\begin{align<em>}
	1 \un{rev} &amp;= 2\pi \un{rad}
\intertext{Since, $360^{\circ}$ is also equal to one revolution,}
	1 \un{rev} &amp;= 360^{\circ} <br />
	2\pi \un{rad} &amp;= 360^{\circ} <br />
	1\un{rad} &amp;= \frac{360\degg}{2\pi}
\end{align</em>}</p>

<p>\begin{tcolorbox}[ams align]
	1 \un{rad} =\frac{180^{\circ} }{\pi}
\end{tcolorbox}
%Ï€ rad=180Â°</p>

<p>The unit ``radâ€™â€™ after the angle is usually used to represent a radian, but this is sometimes omitted since radian is the ratio of the length of the arc to its radius, which cancels out the unit resulting to a  \textit{pure number}.</p>
