I"Ü<p>Definite integrals are integrals that have a start and end values which are called the upper and lower limits. There are many applications of definite integrals, including: the computation of the area under a curve, the volume of the solid of revolution, the length of an arc, the surface area of a revolved arc, centroids, first and second moment of area, as well as other physics problems such as work and static pressures.</p>

<p>Definite Integrals can be easily understood and visualized using the concept of area under a curve. Consider the figure,</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">

  <figcaption><em><p>Figure 1: The area under a curve bounded by the upper and lower limits $a$ and $b$ respectively, the $x$-axis, and the curve itself.</p>
</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The area bounded under the curve $f(x)$, the $x$-axis, the lower limit $a$, and the upper limit $b$ can be more complex to solve, since the area created has an irregular shape. However, it can be approximated by dividing the area into strips of rectangles ($\fref{1}$), and solving for the sum of the area of those rectangular strips.</p>

  <figcaption><em><p>Figure 2: Dividing the area into rectangular strips to approximate the area</p>
</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To analyze the steps we need to undergo, we need to isolate the rectangular strips from each other. Moreover, we can substitute the lower limit $a$ with $x_0$ and the upper limit $b$ with $x_n$, where $n$ repesents the number of rectangular strips the area is divided into.</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/content/IC/IC-4.1.3.png" alt="my alt text" width="400px" />
  <figcaption><em><p>Figure 3: Isolating the first rectangular strip to give emphasis to its parts, $b=\Delta x$ and $h=f(x)$</p>
</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can derive the area of one rectangular strip $A_i$,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	A &amp;= bh \\
	A_i &amp;= [\Delta x_i][f(x_i)] \\
	&amp;= f(x_i)\Delta x_i
\end{align*}\]

<p>Hence, the bounded area is equal to the sum of all the rectangular strips,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	A &amp;= f(x_1)\Delta x_1 + f(x_2)\Delta x_2 + f(x_3)\Delta x_3 + \cdots f(x_n)\Delta x_n \\
\end{align*}\]

<p>Expressing the function as a Reimann Sum,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	A &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i)\Delta x_i
\end{align*}\]

<p>However, we can still improve the equation by increasing the number of the rectangular strips. But as the number of strips $n$ increases, the thickness of each strip $\Delta x$ gets thinner, thus $n$ and $x$ are inversely proportional.</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">

  <figcaption><em><p>Figure 4: Increasing the number of rectangles infinitely to increase the accuracy of approximation of the area under the curve</p>
</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If we increase the number of strips to infinity, we can get a relatively good approximation of the area. However, we cannot directly set $n$ to infinity $\infty$, thus, in order for us to evaluate the function, we can approach $n$ to infinity. 
We have already established that $n$ is inversely proportional to $\Delta x$, hence, as $n$ approaches to infinity, $\Delta x$ approaches 0. Thus, expressing the function as a limit, where $\Delta x$ approaches to 0 gives us,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	A &amp;= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i)\Delta x_i
\end{align*}\]

<p>This equation can then be further simplified by introducing a the <strong>Definite Integral</strong> symbol,</p>

<h2 id="evaluating-definite-integrals">Evaluating Definite Integrals</h2>
<p>Evaluating definite integrals has similar steps as evaluating an indefinite integral. However, in definite integrals, we no longer need the constant of integration $C$, because we will end up with a specific value since this integral already defines specific boundaries.</p>

<p>Definite Integral is evaluated by integrating first the function, then getting the difference of the integral as a function of the upper limit subtracted
by the same integral but as a function of the lower limit.</p>
