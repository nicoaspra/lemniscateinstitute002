I"ô<p>Differentiation of previously differentiated functions is still possible. The process of successively differentiating a function is referred to as <strong>Successive Differentiation</strong>. For instance, the second derivative of a function is achieved by differentiating the first derivative, and differentiating it again yields the third derivative, provided that it is still differentiable. Thus, through Successive Differentiation, <strong>Higher-Order Derivatives</strong> are obtained.</p>

<p>Higher-Order Derivatives can be interpreted differently in various applications; for instance, in Physics, the second derivative of an objectâ€™s displacement with respect to time is referred to as acceleration. In Polynomial Curves, on the other hand, the second derivative of a function is utilized to determine the polynomialâ€™s points of inflection. 
However, before applying this concept to various fields, let us first familiarize ourselves with its notations and solve some fundamental problems.</p>
