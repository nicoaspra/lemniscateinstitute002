<p>In evaluating limits, it is best first to try to substitute the value of $a$ to the function. In this case, if we replace $x$ with 3, we end up with a value.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	\lim_{x \to 3}{(x-1)} &amp;= 3-1\\
	&amp;= 2		\tagans
\end{align*}\]

<p>But letâ€™s try to solve this using the definition of what a limit is by
assigning values to $x$ that approaches $3$ from either sides:</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">

</figure>

<p>Graphing the function gives us,</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/content/DC/DC-2.1.3.png" alt="my alt text" width="250px" />
  <figcaption><em>
</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As $x$ approaches 3 from either sides, the function approaches to 2, and when $x$ is equal to 3, the function is also equal to 2. But you might ask yourself â€œwhat is the use of limits if it just behaves the same as a functionâ€™â€™. Yes, in this example $f(3)=2$, but this is not always the case, to further understand what a limit is, let us solve for the next problem.</p>
