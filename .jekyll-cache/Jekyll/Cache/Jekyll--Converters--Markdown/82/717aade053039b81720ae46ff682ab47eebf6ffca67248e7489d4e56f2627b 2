<p>We have already learned how to explicitly express one variable as a function of another in our lesson in <a href="../DC-1.6-graph-of-functions">Functions</a>. In this example, before we can differentiate to find the rate of change, we must first represent the area of the square as a function of the length of its side.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	\text{Let: } A &amp;= \text{area of the square} &amp;\\
		   x &amp;= \text{length of the side of the square} 
\end{align*}\]

<p>Hence, the equation for the area of a square is,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	A &amp;= x^2 
\end{align*}\]

<p>Then, differentiate $A$ with respect to $x$,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	A+\D{A} &amp;= (x+\Dx)^2 \\
	\D{A} &amp;= \cancel{x^2}+2x\Dx+\Dx^2 - (\cancel{x^2}) \\
	\frac{\D{A}}{\Dx} &amp;= \frac{\cancel{\Dx}(2x+\Dx)}{\cancel{\Dx}} \\
	\frac{dA}{dx} &amp;= 2x		\tagans
\end{align*}\]

<p>Therefore, the rate of change of the area of the square with respect to its side is equal to twice the length of its side.</p>
