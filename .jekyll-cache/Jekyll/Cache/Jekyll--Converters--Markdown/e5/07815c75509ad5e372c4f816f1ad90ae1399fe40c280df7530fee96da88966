I"<p>From the <a href="../2.2-vector-addition-and-subtraction">previous section</a>, we already discussed the main difference between a scalar and a vector quantity and had some examples regarding this particular topic. To recall, distance is a scalar quantity, and displacement is a vector. Distance refers to “how much ground an object has covered.” While displacement refers to “how far the object is from its starting position,” we could also interpret this as a “change in its position.”</p>

<p>Distance is usually represented by the symbol $s$, and the displacement by the symbol $\vv{s}$. And since the displacement measures the change in position, if $s_i$ is the object’s initial position and $s_f$ is the final position, we can denote the displacement as,</p>

	\mathrm{displacement}=\Delta\vv{s}=s_f-s_i
