I" %<p>In the seventeenth century, sir Isaac Newton have established the foundations of what we now know as Classical Mechanics, or often referred as Newtonian Mechanics.
However, we are more concerned with its underlying principles, which are Newton’s Laws of Motion. 
Newton established three fundamental laws, and in this section, we will try to grasp and build up our understanding with these laws.</p>

<h3 id="first-law-of-motion">First Law of Motion</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will retain its motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first sentence is rather self-explanatory: “an object at rest will remain at rest”; a car parked on stable ground will almost certainly not move unless someone intends for it to do so, or until it is acted upon by some force. The second statement may appear counterintuitive, since we are accustomed to the assumption that everything eventually comes to a halt; just as the ball thrown upwards, will soon fall and will eventually stop moving. However, assuming that  we take all the external forces away such as gravity and the air resistance, the ball is supposed to continue traveling at a constant pace throughout perpetuity.</p>

<p>With this in mind, force does not cause a moving object to continue moving, rather it enables the object to stop moving.
In both cases, a body remains at rest or a body moving with a constant velocity in a straight line, both experience zero net force.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Fist Law of Motion is sometimes called the Law of Inertia.</li>
  <li>To illustrate what inertia is, consider the following scenario.</li>
  <li>Pushing a motorcycle form rest requires less force than pushing a car at the same condition.</li>
  <li>By applying the same force to both vehicles, we can simply deduce that the motorcycle will achieve a greater change in velocity than the car.</li>
  <li>Similarly, if both vehicles are moving at the same rate, stopping the car will take a greater amount of force than the motorcycle.</li>
  <li>In this case, we can say that the car has a larger inertia than the motorcycle.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Inertia is simply the resistance of the object to change its velocity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you’re familiar with the meme in figure 1, this is a perfect example of the Law of Inertia. While the vehicle may be equipped with breaks, the boulder it is transporting has none. As a result of its great mass and inertia, the boulder’s natural tendency is to continue moving. We can also observe this behavior while driving a car; if the brakes are applied suddenly, our body’s natural impulse is to continue forward. However, compared to a boulder, the effect on us is not hat profound since we have less inertia than the boulder.</li>

  <li>To easily remember the first law, it is simply the tendency of the object to stubbornly maintain what it is already doing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="second-law-of-motion">Second Law of Motion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>According to the first law, motions with zero net force exist when a body is at rest or moving at a constant velocity (no acceleration). However, in the following law, we will attempt to comprehend motions that experience a net force.</li>
  <li>For instance, a boy pushes a wagon from rest. The wagon with a mass $m$ would most probably accelerate. If the wagon is loaded and the mass is increased while maintaining the same force, the acceleration will most likely be smaller than it was previously. This concept enables us to describe the relationship between the three parameters.  Acceleration is directly proportional to the net force and its magnitude is inversely proportional to the mass. Note that the direction of the force is the same as the acceleration.
\(\begin{align*}
  \vv{a} = \frac{\sum\vv{F}}{m} \qquad\text{or}\qquad 
  \sum\vv{F} = m\vv{a}
\end{align*}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>SI Unit of Force: $\mathrm{Newton \,(N)}=\mathrm{kg\cdot\frac{m}{s^2}}</p>

<p>$</p>

<ul>
  <li>One Newton is the amount of net force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram to one meter per second squared.</li>
  <li>The net force in Newton’s Second Law relates to external forces, as everything requires an external force to move.</li>
  <li>If it were possible for a body to affect its own motion, we don’t need a floor to walk, we can simply levitate and walk on the air.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>To understand how external forces affects an object, let’s have another example. For instance, you are pushing a crate on a flat ground. The crate experience several forces: An applied force you are exerting to the crate, a frictional force that resist the sliding motion, its weight, and the normal force exerted by the ground.</li>
  <li>In this example, the forces on the vertical axis cancels each other out, if it weren’t, the the crate would either float or sink depending on what force of the two is grater.</li>
  <li>Hence, we will focus on the two forces parallel with the horizontal axis, the applied force $P$ and the frictional force $F$ since the motion will most probably occur in this axis.</li>
  <li>Solely by intuition, we can already determine the direction of the crate, it would be at the same direction as the applied force $P$. Hence, the net force $\sum F$ or simply the vector sum of the forces in the horizontal direction. Base from figure –, the acceleration is towards</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="third-law-of-motion">Third Law of Motion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The third law of motion is often called the “Law of Action-Reaction”, since some may quote it as “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” Where whenever an object exerts a force to another object, the second object exerts a force that has the same magnitude as the first object but opposite in direction.</li>
  <li>For you to stand still on the floor, an opposite force reacted by the floor to your feet is what enables you to stand still. If ever the floor does not give the same amount of force in an upward direction, you would inevitably fall since your body always experience an external force, your weight, which points in a downward direction; or in a different perspective, to the center of the earth.</li>
  <li>This law also explains why punching a concrete wall is much more painful when you punch harder. The amount of force you exert while punching the wall will be the same as the force of the wall towards your fist.</li>
  <li>If you come to think of it, if you punch something, it will punch you back with the the same amount of force.</li>
  <li>Mathematically, we can express the third law of motion as:</li>
  <li>
\[F_{12}=-F_{21}\]
  </li>
  <li>Where $F_{12}$ is the force exerted by object 1 to object 2 (action), and $F_{21}$ is the force exerted by object 2 to object 1 (reaction). The negative symbol denotes that the force of the second object is pointing opposite the force of the first object.</li>
</ul>
