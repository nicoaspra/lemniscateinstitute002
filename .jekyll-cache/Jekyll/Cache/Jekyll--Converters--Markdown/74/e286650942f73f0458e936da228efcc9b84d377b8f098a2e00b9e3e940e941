<p>In the previous lesson, we have introduced the concept of charges, in this lesson, we will expand that concept on how interactions of charges build-up to the concept of electricity as we know it. To accomplish this, we will look into two fundamental concepts: Coulombâ€™s Law and Electrical Field. By understanding these two notions, we can further understand how a simple concept as electrical charges forms the foundation of electricity and electrical parameters.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-objectives">Lesson Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this lesson you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>determine the force between two or more charges suing Coulombâ€™s Law;</li>
  <li>describe what an electric field is; and</li>
  <li>evaluate problems in electric field.</li>
</ul>
