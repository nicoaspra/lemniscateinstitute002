<p>In the previous lessons, we were introduced to the concept that electricity is a form of energy expressed in terms of, or derived from, the movement and interactions of electrons.</p>

<p>We also learned that we could quantify electrons through a concept called electrical charge. Though atoms generally have zero net charges, there are cases where an atom <strong>gains or losses an electron</strong> that results in either a positive net charge or negative net charge.</p>

<p>We can recall that these net charges interact (either attraction or repulsion) with each other obeying Coulomb’s law. Since net force can be achieved between charges, an <strong>electron drift</strong> can be observed.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we will focus our attention on this electron drift and how a closed circuit generates or utilizes electrical energy. But before that, let us recall the fundamental concept of electrical charges.</p>

<h2 id="review"><em>Review:</em></h2>

<p><em>A charge is defined as an electrical property of the atomic particles that consists of matter. It is measured in coulombs [C], named after French Engineer and Physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb.</em></p>

<p><em>An electron’s charge $(e)$ is quantified as equal to $1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$ and has
a negative charge. What this means is that every electron intrinsically contains
$-1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$, and it requires $6.24 \x 10^{18} \un{electrons}$ to gain one (1) coulomb of charge. Similarly, a single proton also contains 1:602  10􀀀19 C in magnitude but has a positive charge. Hence, one proton contains +1:602  10􀀀19 C. The presence
of equal numbers of protons and electrons in an atom makes it neutrally charged
(The algebraic sum of charges is zero).</em></p>
