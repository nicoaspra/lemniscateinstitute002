<!-- Before proceeding with our topic, it is essential to develop a strong understanding of the basic rules and laws governing exponential and logarithmic functions. It is also crucial to appreciate the importance of these functions in many real-world applications. Exponential and logarithmic functions are present in various fields, specifically in modelling population growth, cell growth and decay, financial growth and depreciation, and radioactive decay, to name a few of its applications. Nevertheless, you can review some of the fundamental laws and concepts underlying these functions to better understand this topic. -->

<p>Before proceeding with our topic, it is essential to understand the basic rules and laws governing <a href="../DC-8.1-exponential-functions">exponential</a> and <a href="../DC-8.2-logarithmic-functions">logarithmic</a> functions. It is also crucial to appreciate the importance of these functions in many real-world applications.

Nevertheless, you can review some of the fundamental laws and concepts underlying these functions to understand this topic better.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to integrate both exponential and logarithmic functions. However, before we can proceed, it is best to review the methods of differentiating these functions. Considering that integration is the inverse of differentiation; thus, understanding the relationship between the two methods is ideal for us to have a deeper appreciation of this topic.</p>

<h1 id="integration-formulas-for-exponential-and-logarithmic-functions">Integration Formulas for Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</h1>
<p>Considering the differential formulas that we have explored above, we can now derive an anti-derivative or integration formulas for the exponential and logarithmic functions.</p>
