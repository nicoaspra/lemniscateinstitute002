Nevertheless, you can review some of the fundamental laws and concepts underlying these functions to understand this topic better.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to integrate both exponential and logarithmic functions. However, before we can proceed, it is best to review the methods of differentiating these functions. Considering that integration is the inverse of differentiation; thus, understanding the relationship between the two methods is ideal for us to have a deeper appreciation of this topic.</p>
