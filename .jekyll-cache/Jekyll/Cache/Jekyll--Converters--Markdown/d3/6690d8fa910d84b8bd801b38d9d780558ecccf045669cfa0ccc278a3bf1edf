<p>$\For{a}$ <br />
For an equation to be considered a function, there must only be one output for every input. So for instance, if we replace $x$ with 1,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	y &amp;= 2x^2+1 \\
	&amp;= 2(1)^2+1 \\
	&amp;= 3
\end{align*}\]

<p>The output is 3. And even if we replace $x$ with any value, there is only one possible output, therefore $y=2x^2+1$ is a <strong>function</strong>.</p>

<p>$\For{b}$ <br />
In testing if an equation is a function, we can substitute any value for the independent variable. However, it is crucial to replace it with a value that we can easily simplify. Otherwise, it will utterly complicate the solution. For this example, letâ€™s try substituting $x$ with 6:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	y &amp;= \sqrt{x+3} \\
	&amp;= \sqrt{(6)+3} \\
	&amp;= \sqrt{9} \\
	&amp;= 3
\end{align*}\]

<p>When we replace $x$ with 6, we get a single value $y = 3$. This is likely true if we replace $x$ with any value within the range where the square root is defined ($y$  has a real value). For the function to give a valid value of  $y$, the result of the expression inside the square root must be non-negative (i.e.,  $x \geq -3$). Nonetheless, $y = \sqrt{x+3}$ is considered a <strong>function</strong>.</p>

<p>Note that the output is only positive, and not $\pm 3$, since we are referring to the <strong>principal square root</strong>. This might seem to contradict the fact that the result of a square root can be both positive and negative. However, this only happens in equations where the variable is originally squared. To understand this better, letâ€™s take a look at the next example.</p>

<p>$\For{c}$ <br />
This might seem similar to the previous example, but here we focus on the dependent variable $y$. Since $y$ is squared, replacing $y$ with either a positive or negative value will result in the same value. For instance, 2 and $-2$; squaring either of these will result in 4. Thus, when we isolate $y$ by taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we need to indicate a $\pm$ symbol to represent both possible values:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	y^2 &amp;= x+3 \\
	y &amp;= \pm\sqrt{x+3}
\end{align*}\]

<p>If $x = 6$,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	\phantom{y^2}  &amp;= \pm\sqrt{9} \\
	  &amp;= \pm3
\end{align*}\]

<p>Thus, if $x=6$, $y$ can be either $3$ or $-3$. This means that for a single input $x$, we can have two possible outputs. Hence, $y^2=x+3$ is <strong>not a function</strong></p>
