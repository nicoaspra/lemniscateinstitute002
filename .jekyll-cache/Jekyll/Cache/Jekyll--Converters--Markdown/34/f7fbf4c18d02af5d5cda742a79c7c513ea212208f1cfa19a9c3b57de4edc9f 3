<p>In the previous lesson, the concept of voltage and current was introduced and how they play a vital part in a circuit. Another parameter mentioned is the resistance which is the proportionality constant in the relationship between voltage and current in Ohmâ€™s Law.
In the following lessons, we will introduce the concept of resistance, conductance, and resistivity and learn to calculate the resistance of various materials under various conditions.</p>

<h1 id="lesson-objectives">Lesson Objectives</h1>
<p>At the end of this lesson you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>define resistance;</li>
  <li>discuss the concept of resistivity;</li>
  <li>discuss the relationship between area, length, and resistance;</li>
  <li>calculate resistances of given materials; and</li>
  <li>solve for the adjusted resistance of a material as the temperature changes.</li>
</ul>
