I"Š<p>Before we can learn how to add and subtract vectors, we must first familiarize ourselves with some of the common types of vectors. Therefore, in this section, we will explore only a few of its types that can help us better understand how vectors work.</p>

<h3 id="equal-vectors">Equal Vectors</h3>
<p>Vectors with the <strong>same magnitude and direction</strong> are considered equal regardless of their location. Thus, even if their start and end positions differ, they are still deemed equal as long as their attributes remain unchanged. With this in mind, we can reposition vectors without affecting their value.</p>

<h3 id="negative-vectors">Negative Vectors</h3>
<p>If two vectors have the <strong>same magnitude but opposite in direction</strong>, one vector is the negative vector of the other. In Figure 2, vector $\vv{B}$ is equal to the negative of vector $\vv{A}$, $\vv{B}=-\vv{A}$, or vice versa $\vv{A}=-\vv{B}$.</p>

<h1 id="vector-addition">Vector Addition</h1>

<p>The <strong>addition of vectors</strong> is not as straightforward as adding scalar quantities.
For us to fully grasp the concept, let us have an example. Say a man walks $7\un{m}$ to the right, then $5\un{m}$ to the opposite direction (see Figure 3), the total <strong>distance</strong> (scalar) traveled by the man is $5\un{m} + 7\un{m} = 12 \un{m}$, but its <strong>displacement</strong> (vector) is $2\un{m}$ to the right.
Note that the direction of the resultant vector points the objectâ€™s initial position to its final position.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to add vectors that are not parallel to one another, we will need some trigonometry skills. However, in this lesson, we will concentrate on its graphical representation in order to visualize the vectors before attempting to solve such problems.</p>

<p>Consider Figure 4a, if we are to find the sum of the two vectors, $\vv{A}+\vv{B}$. We can solve it by placing the tail of vector $\vv{B}$ at the tip of the vector $\vv{A}$ (Figure 4b), then connecting the tail of $\vv{A}$ to the tip of $\vv{B}$; thus, giving us a resulting vector $\vv{R}$ is what we now call the <strong>vector sum</strong> or the <strong>resultant</strong>. We would also arrive at the same results even if we reverse the order (Figure 4c). Furthermore, we could also add the vectors by constructing a parallelogram (Figure 4d).</p>
