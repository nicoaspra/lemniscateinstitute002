I"#<p>From our past lesson, we have already learned how to determine if an equation represents a function or not. 
In this section, let us discuss how to determine if a graph represents a function or not using the Vertical Line Test.</p>

<p>The method is relatively straightforward. If we can draw a vertical line that <strong>intersects the graph more than once</strong>, the graph is considered <strong>NOT A FUNCTION</strong> since a function must only have a single output for every input. Furthermore, the number of intersections of the graph and the vertical line represents the number of outputs the graph has at a specific input.</p>
