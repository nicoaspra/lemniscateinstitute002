<p>In this example, we cannot simply match the base of the terms, but remember that any number or variable with an exponent of 0 is equal to 1. And we can use this concept and equate the exponent of $\frac{1}{2}$ to 0. This gives us,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	2x+1 &amp;= 0 \\
	2x &amp;= -1 \\
	x &amp;= -\frac{1}{2}	\tagans
\end{align*}\]
