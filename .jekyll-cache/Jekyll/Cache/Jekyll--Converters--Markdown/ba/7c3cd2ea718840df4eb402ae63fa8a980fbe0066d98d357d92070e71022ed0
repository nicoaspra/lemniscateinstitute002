<p>From the previous sections, we have already well established that the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $yâ€™$ in Lagrangeâ€™s notation indicates the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$, which can also be represented graphically as the slope of a curve at a certain point. Additionally, we learned in Chapter 3 that the direction of a slope is determined by its sign. With this in mind, we can tell whether a continuous curve increases or decreases based on its slope.</p>

<p>The function increases if the direction of the graph is going upwards. Hence, having a slope with a positive value ($yâ€™&gt;0$) or $y$ increases as $x$ increases will indicate that the function increases at a specific interval. On the contrary, having a slope with a negative value ($y&lt;0$) or $y$ decreases as $x$ increases will indicate that the function decreases at a specific interval.</p>

<p>However, a function can increase in two ways: either increasing at a decreasing rate (\fref{fig:dir of inc and dec func 1.1}) or increasing at an increasing rate (\fref{fig:dir of inc and dec func 1.2}). Similarly, a function can also decrease at a decreasing rate (\fref{fig:dir of inc and dec func 1.3}) or decrease at an increasing rate (\fref{fig:dir of inc and dec func 1.4}). The direction of a function can reveal a great deal about it, particularly when it comes to identifying the graphâ€™s behavior, which is very valuable when sketching curves.</p>
