I"&<p>In determining the equation of a line, there are different methods available. However in our case, since we can easily determine the slope of the line by differentiation and the point will most likely be available, we can specifically use the Point-Slope Form ($\eref{eq:pt-slope of a line}$) .</p>

<p>Point-slope Form, by the name suggests, can be used to determine the equation of a line by using two parameters, namely: a point, and a slope of a line. To understand more how we can use this form, it is best to solve some problems.</p>
