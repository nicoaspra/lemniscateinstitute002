I"u	<p>Infinity is a mathematical concept that describes anything that has no bounds and is usually denoted by the symbol “$\infty$”. Infinity can specify an infinitely large or infinitely small quantity, and a positive “$+$” or negative “$-$” sign is written before the infinity symbol to indicate its direction on the number line.</p>

<p>Consider a pizza sliced into 8 equal parts (\fref{fig:limits at infinity of a fraction 1/8}), each one will get $\frac{1}{8}$ or 0.125 part of the pizza. If it is sliced to 50 parts, each will get $\frac{1}{50}$ or 0.02 part of the pizza (\fref{fig:limits at infinity of a fraction 1/50}). 
%Let’s denote the number of slices as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$x$'' and the size of each piece relative to the whole as</code>$n$’’. 
And as the number of slices $x$ increases, the size of each slice $n$ decreases.  Hence, $x$ and $n$ are inversely proportional to each other $\frac{1}{x}=n$.</p>

<p>So, if the pizza is divided into infinite pieces, the size of each slice cannot be simply measured, since $\frac{1}{\infty}$ is undefined. But if we \textit{approach} the number of slices to infinity, the size of each slice will definitely approach to zero. 
%
\(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x}=0\)
%
This can also be shown by graphing the function $y =\frac{1}{x}$ (\fref{fig:limits at infinity of a fraction 1/x}), 
which denotes not only as $x$ approaches infinity is equal to zero, but also as $x$ approaches negative infinity.</p>

<p>%which also adds that not only as $x$ approaches infinity is zero, but also as $x$ approaches to negative infinity. Hence,</p>
