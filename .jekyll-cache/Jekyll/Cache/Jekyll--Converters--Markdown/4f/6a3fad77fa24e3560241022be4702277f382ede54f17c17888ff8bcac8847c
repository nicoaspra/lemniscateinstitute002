I"<p><strong>Integration</strong> is simply the calculation of an integral. Integrals as a solution to differential functions that have undergone integration can be classified into two, namely the <strong>Definite</strong> and <strong>Indefinite</strong> Integral.</p>

<p>When we refer to the <em>application of integrals</em>, it usually pertains to the application of definite integrals. Definite integrals result from the integration of functions with <strong>defined boundaries</strong> (limits), integrals that result in specific values. However, we will focus on this notion in later chapters of this course.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Indefinite integrals <em>do not contain defined boundaries</em>; hence, the result of the integration process is a function of the given variable.</p>
