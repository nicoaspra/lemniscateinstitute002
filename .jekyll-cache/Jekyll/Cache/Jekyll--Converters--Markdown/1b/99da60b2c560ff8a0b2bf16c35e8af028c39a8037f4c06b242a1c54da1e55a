<p>$\For{a}$ <br />
For an equation to be considered a function, there must only be one output for every input. So for instance, if we replace $x$ with 1,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	y &amp;= 2x^2+1 \\
	&amp;= 2(1)^2+1 \\
	&amp;= 3
\end{align*}\]

<p>The output is 3. And even if we replace $x$ with any value, there is only one possible output, therefore $y=2x^2+1$ is a <strong>function</strong>.</p>

<p>$\For{b}$ <br />
In testing if an equation is a function, we can substitute any value for the independent variable. However, it is crucial to replace it with a value that we can easily simplify. Otherwise, it will utterly complicate the solution. For this example, letâ€™s try substituting $x$ with 6:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	y &amp;= \sqrt{x+3} \\
	&amp;= \sqrt{(6)+3} \\
	&amp;= \sqrt{9} \\
	&amp;= 3
\end{align*}\]

<p>When we replace $x$ with 6, we get a single value $y = 3$. This is likely true if we replace $x$ with any value within the range where the square root is defined ($y$  has a real value). For the function to give a valid value of  $y$, the result of the expression inside the square root must be non-negative (i.e.,  $x \geq -3$). Nonetheless, $y = \sqrt{x+3}$ is considered a <strong>function</strong>.</p>
