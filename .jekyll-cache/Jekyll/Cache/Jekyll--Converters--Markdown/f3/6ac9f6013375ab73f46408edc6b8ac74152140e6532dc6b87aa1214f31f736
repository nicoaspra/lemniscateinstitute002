I"Î<p>From the previous lessons, weâ€™ve already learned how to analyze and solve kinematic problems in one dimension. However, in real-world applications, one-dimensional examples are rarely sufficient. To broaden our understanding of motion, we can add another dimension to explore additional applications; these motions are referred to as Two-Dimensional Kinematics. Analyzing motions in two dimensions can be a little overwhelming at first. However, we can simplify the solution by breaking down every parameter into two components so that we can utilize the concepts and equations of one-dimensional kinematics, which we already know how to manipulate.</p>

<p>To understand how displacement, velocity, and acceleration act in a two-dimensional motion, consider a ball thrown at an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Breaking down the motion into two dimensions will result in two independent one-dimensional motions. On the $y$-axis, the ball may seem to be thrown vertically upwards, indicating that it is experiencing a downward acceleration due to gravity. At the $x$-axis, on the other hand,  the ball is traveling at a constant rate in a perfectly horizontal motion. Take note that on the $x$-axis, if it is parallel with the horizon, we can disregard acceleration since the gravitational acceleration does not influence it.</p>

<p>However, in not all cases, the x-axis will have no acceleration, so breaking down the problem and analyzing what is happening on the object is still necessary.</p>
