*A charge is defined as an electrical property of the atomic particles that consists of matter. It is measured in coulombs [C], named after French Engineer and Physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb.*

*An electron’s charge (e) is quantified as equal to 1:602  10􀀀19 C and has
a negative charge. What this means is that every electron intrinsically contains
􀀀1:602  10􀀀19 C, and it requires 6:24  1018 electrons to gain one (1) coulomb of
charge. Similarly, a single proton also contains 1:602  10􀀀19 C in magnitude but has a positive charge. Hence, one proton contains +1:602  10􀀀19 C. The presence
of equal numbers of protons and electrons in an atom makes it neutrally charged
(The algebraic sum of charges is zero).*
