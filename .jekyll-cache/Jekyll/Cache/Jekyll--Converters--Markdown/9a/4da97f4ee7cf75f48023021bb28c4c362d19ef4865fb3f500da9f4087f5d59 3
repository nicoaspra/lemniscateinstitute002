<p>By substituting $x$ to the function with $2$, the result will be $\frac{4-4}{2-2}= \frac{0}{0} $, which is undefined. With this in mind, let us assign values to $x$ that approaches $2$ from either sides,</p>

<p>We can now plot the graph, where the function is defined for all real numbers except when $x=2$.</p>

<p>The figure shows that the function approaches 4 as $x$ approaches 2 from either sides (left or right), except when $x$ is exactly equal to 2 where the function is undefined. But since a limit mostly cares about what it approaches regardless of the destination, we can say that the limit of the function is 4.</p>

<p>You can also try interacting with the graph above. If you try hovering your cursor close to $x=2$, you will get a value for $y$. However, when you arrive at <strong>EXACTLY</strong> $x=2$, the value of your $y$-component is <strong>undefined</strong>. This shows that even if $f(2)$ is undefined, we are still approaching a specific value, which is 4.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the limit of this type of function can also be solved by simplifying the function first before substituting the value to the equation,</p>

\[\begin{align*}
	\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2-4}{x-2} &amp;= \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{(x+2) \cancel{(x-2)} }{ \cancel{x-2} } \\
	&amp;= \lim_{x \to 2} {x+2} \\
	&amp;= 2+2 \\
	&amp;= 4    \tagans
\end{align*}\]
