<p>In the previous lessons, we were introduced to the concept that electricity is a form of energy expressed in terms of, or derived from, the movement and interactions of electrons.</p>

<p>We also learned that we could quantify electrons through a concept called electrical charge. Though atoms generally have zero net charges, there are cases where an atom <strong>gains or losses an electron</strong> that results in either a positive net charge or negative net charge.</p>

<p>We can recall that these net charges interact (either attraction or repulsion) with each other obeying Coulomb’s law. Since net force can be achieved between charges, an <strong>electron drift</strong> can be observed.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we will focus our attention on this electron drift and how a closed circuit generates or utilizes electrical energy. But before that, let us recall the fundamental concept of electrical charges.</p>

<h2 id="review"><em>Review:</em></h2>

<p><em>A charge is defined as an electrical property of the atomic particles that consists of matter. It is measured in coulombs [C], named after French Engineer and Physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb.</em></p>

<p>An <strong>electron’s charge</strong> ($e$) is quantified as being equal to $1.602 \x 10^{-19}$ coulombs $(C)$ and has a <strong>negative charge</strong>.  What this means is that every electron intrinsically contains $–1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$, and it requires $6.24 \x 10^{18} \un{electrons}$ to gain one (1) coulomb of charge.</p>

<p>Similarly, a single <strong>proton</strong> contains $1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$ in magnitude but <strong>positive in charge</strong>. Hence, one proton contains $+1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$.</p>

<p>The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons in an atom makes it neutrally charged (The algebraic sum of charges is zero).</p>
