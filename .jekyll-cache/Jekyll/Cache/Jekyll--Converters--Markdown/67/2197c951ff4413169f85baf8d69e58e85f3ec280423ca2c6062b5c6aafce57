I"`<p>An intuitive way to determine if a function is <strong>continuous</strong>, is if the graph of such function <strong>can be drawn without lifting up the pen</strong>, which emphasizes that there is no break on the curve. However, there are also instances that a graph cannot be easily sketched especially if the function is complicated. In such cases, continuity can be determined mathematically.</p>

<p>We can determine if the function is continuous if $\lim\limits_{x\to a}{f(x)}$ <strong>exists</strong>, $f(a)$ is defined, and $\lim\limits_{x\to a}{f(x)}=f(a)$, which tells us that the value of the function where $x=a$ is equal to the limit $f(a)=L$.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since the limit must exist in order for a function to be continuous, the left-hand and right-hand limits of the function must be approaching to the same value. $\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}{f(x)}=\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}{f(x)}$. Otherwise, if the conditions are not satisfied, the function is said to be <strong>discontinuous</strong>.</p>

<p>Consider the graph in Figure 2a, the curve has a hole at $x=a$ and $f(a)=1$ hence, $\lim\limits_{x\to a}{f(x)} \neq f(a)$ and thus, the function is <strong>discontinuous</strong> at $x=a$. 
In Figure 2b, the curve suddenly jumps at $x=a$ hence, 
$\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}{f(x)} \neq \lim\limits_{x\to a^+}{f(x)}$ and thus, the function is also <strong>discontinuous</strong> at $x=a$. 
And in Figure 2c, the curve has no hole nor did it jump and $\lim\limits_{x\to a}{f(x)}=f(a)$ hence, the function is <strong>continuous</strong> at $x=a$.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-discontinuities">Types of Discontinuities</h2>
<p>There are two types of discontinuities: <strong>Removable</strong> and <strong>Non-Removable</strong> Discontinuity.
Think of if this way, if its removable “something is missing” and if its non-removable “it suddenly jumps”.</p>

<p>Consider the graph of a removable discontinuity (Figure 3a), we can easily make the function continuous by just plugging the hole at $x=a$. However, for the non-removable discontinuities, the left and right hand limits are approaching different values so, these type of discontinuities are much easier to visually distinguish from a continuous function (Figures 3b and 3c).</p>

<p>$\tcB{Removal Discontinuity}$
The curve in a removal discontinuity appears to be continuous except at the point where $x=a$ (\fref{fig:types of discontinuity 1.1}). In this type of discontinuity, the limit still exists but $f(a)$ is either undefined or not equal to the limit.
%
\(\lim\limits_{x\to a}{f(x)}=L\)
\(f(a) \neq L\)</p>

<p>\typB{Jump Discontinuity (Non-Removal Discontinuity)}
	The curve in jump discontinuity (\fref{fig:types of discontinuity 1.2}) is disconnected at the point $x=a$, these appears when the left and right hand limits are not equal to each other. 
	\(\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}{f(x)} \neq \lim\limits_{x\to a^+}{f(x)}\)</p>

<p>\typB{Asymptotic Discontinuity (Non-Removal Discontinuity)}
	In asymptotic discontinuity, the curve approaches the line $x=a$ but does not meet with each other. Simply put, the line $x=a$ is the asymptote of the curve (\fref{fig:types of discontinuity 1.3}). This type of discontinuity is sometimes called as \tcA{Infinite Discontinuity} since it occurs if the limit approaches to positive or negative infinity.</p>
