  <li>In the previous lesson, we have established that integration (indefinite integral in particular) is simply the reverse of differentiation. Hence, in this lesson we will investigate one of the most common and useful basic integration processes, the general power rule.</li>
  <li>The general power rule for integration can be associated as the inverse of the general power rule for differentiation.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, you can also have an in-depth review of the power rule for differentiation before starting this lesson for a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Before we start our discussion with the general power rule, let us first introduce the properties of indefinite integrals. These properties is a necessary prerequesite before we can introduce the different processes of applying integration techniques in a differential function.</li>
  <li>For the following formulas for evaluating indefinite integrals, let $u$, $v$ and $w$ be a function of $x$; $a$ and $n$ as constants; and $C$ as the constant of integration.</li>
  <li>If you could recall, the steps in differentiating using the power rule, the steps includes multiplying the exponent of the variable to the term then reducing the value of the exponent by one. However, in integration, it is the reverse of that. The first step is adding one to the exponent, then dividing the whole term with with the same value of variableâ€™s new exponent.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Assuming that you have already reviewed the concepts of differentials, we can observe that the general power formula for differentials follows two basic steps: (1) multiplying the function with the original exponent $n$, and (2) subtracting 1 from the original exponent $n$. Interestingly, it can be observed that we can apply anti-differentiation (integration) through \textit{reversing the steps} mentioned. Thus, for the general power rule for integration, we add 1 from the exponent $n$ then divide the function with the new exponent $n+1$. Equation \ref{eq:integration - general power rule} shows the formula described.</li>
