<strong style="color:#d02f5d">Lemniscate Institute</strong> is a virtual learning platform for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students, both in Senior High School and Higher Education levels. Topics covered range from fundamental mathematics and sciences to advanced engineering topics.

The objective of the page is to provide comprehensive, **self-directed** learning instructional materials to complement and/or supplement the learning activities offered in the traditional class.

In using this platform, learners are expected to develop a deeper understanding of the topics presented, hone their skills in analyzing and solving problems, and apply the core principles learned in every lesson.
